  <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
  <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
  <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
  
  <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
  <p id="winston-says"></p>
  <script>
      var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
      ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "<em>I am always <strong>sad</strong> because I don't have <strong>money</strong></em>"
      var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
      winstonSays.textContent = "that is how Oh Noes is!"
  </script>
